(* Module: "clk_div.ml" *)
(* Very simple fabric-based clk-divider.

   Note that past like 150MHz this cannot be expected to function correctly due to clk
   skew, and that proper items from hardcaml_xilinx ought to be utilized. Parameterizing
   the ratio does not change that: this is a counter MSB, not a clock resource, and a
   [divisor] that makes it look like a general clocking primitive is exactly the use the
   paragraph above warns off.

   [divisor] is the division ratio and defaults to four, the value the ratio was hardcoded
   at before it became an argument. The output is the MSB of a [ceil_log2 divisor]-bit
   free-running counter, so the ratio has to be a power of two and at least two; anything
   else is rejected at elaboration time rather than silently rounded. Two is the floor
   because a divisor of one would ask for a zero-width register, which Hardcaml rejects
   with a message that does not mention the divisor - the same trap [second_pulse] falls
   into at [clk_freq = 1]. Duty cycle is exactly half for every legal ratio.
