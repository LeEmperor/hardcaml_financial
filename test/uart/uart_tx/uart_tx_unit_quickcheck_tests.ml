   Typed examples and generated properties for the UART transmitter.

   The headline property is the round trip: a random byte transmitted, then decoded by
   [Uart_receiver], must come back unchanged, with a space start bit and a mark stop bit
   and no symbol that moved mid-interval. It is run across tick spacings and across enable
   stalls, because the whole point of a tick-driven transmitter is that neither changes
   the frame it sends - only how long it takes to send it.

   The examples pin the bytes whose bit patterns a random draw is least likely to
   distinguish: 0x00 and 0xFF (which make the data field indistinguishable from the start
   and stop bits respectively), and 0x55 / 0xAA (which differ only by bit order, so a
   transmitter that sent most significant bit first would pass one and fail the other).
